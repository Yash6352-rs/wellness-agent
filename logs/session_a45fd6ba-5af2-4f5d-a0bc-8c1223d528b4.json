  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas that could use a boost.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with a lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall health.  Let's work on getting you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to get started:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.  Even small improvements can make a big difference. Try establishing a relaxing bedtime routine \u2013 maybe a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music \u2013 to help you wind down.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your snack, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity, like a walk around the block, a few stretches, or some light cleaning.\n\n\nRemember, small, consistent changes are key. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Focus on one or two of these tips and gradually build from there. You've got this!"
