It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with a lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall well-being.  Let's work on getting you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to get started:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.  Try establishing a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends, and create a relaxing bedtime routine to help you wind down (e.g., warm bath, reading a book).  Even small improvements in sleep can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.  Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your snack, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity each day, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you feel comfortable.\n\n\nRemember, progress, not perfection, is key.  Small, consistent changes will lead to big improvements in your overall wellness.  If you continue to feel tired and sad, consider talking to a healthcare professional."
