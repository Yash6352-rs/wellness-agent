It's completely understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with a lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall health.  Let's work on getting you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  Try establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine (like a warm bath or reading), and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Even a small improvement in sleep can make a big difference in your energy levels and mood.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Even a small, healthy snack like an apple or a handful of nuts is better than nothing.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk or some light stretching can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity each day, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you feel more comfortable.\n\n\nRemember, small changes add up!  Focus on making one or two improvements at a time, and be kind to yourself throughout the process.  If you continue to feel tired and sad, consider reaching out to a healthcare professional or therapist for support."
