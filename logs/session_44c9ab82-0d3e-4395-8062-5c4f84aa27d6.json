  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas that could use a boost.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall health.  Let's work on getting you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to get started:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  Try establishing a regular bedtime routine to help your body wind down.  Even small changes like avoiding screens an hour before bed can make a difference.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.  Even a small healthy snack like an apple or a handful of nuts is better than nothing.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity each day, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you feel comfortable.\n\n\nRemember, small steps lead to big changes.  Focus on making one or two improvements at a time, and be kind to yourself throughout the process. You've got this!"
