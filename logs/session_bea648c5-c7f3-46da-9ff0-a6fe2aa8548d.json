  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas we could work on together.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with a lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall well-being.  Let's aim to make some small, positive changes.  Don't feel pressured to do everything at once \u2013 just pick one or two things to focus on.\n\nHere are three tips to help you improve:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Try creating a relaxing bedtime routine \u2013 maybe a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music \u2013 to help you wind down before bed.  Even small improvements in sleep can make a big difference in your energy levels and mood.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal or snack \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.  Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your snack, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity, like a walk around the block, a few stretches, or some light housework.  Find an activity you enjoy and make it a regular part of your day.\n\n\nRemember, small, consistent changes are key. You've got this!"
