  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas that could use a boost.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with a lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall well-being.  Let's work on getting you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to get started:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  Try establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading), and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Even small improvements in sleep can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal \u2013 think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.  Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your snack, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start with 15-20 minutes of light activity, like a brisk walk or some stretching, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you feel more comfortable.\n\n\nRemember, small, consistent changes are key. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Focus on one or two of these tips and build from there. You've got this!"
