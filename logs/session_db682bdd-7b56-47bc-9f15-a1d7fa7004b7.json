  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas that could use a boost.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall well-being.  Don't worry, small changes can make a big difference!\n\nHere are three tips to help you feel better:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep & Hydration:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep tonight.  Even 30 minutes extra can help.  Also, try to increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day. Keep a water bottle handy as a visual reminder.\n\n2. **Nourish Your Body:**  Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal or snack.  Think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your chip and cola, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:** Even a short walk, some stretching, or a quick dance session can improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 just 10-15 minutes of light activity can make a difference.\n\n\nRemember, progress, not perfection, is key.  Focus on making one or two small changes at a time, and you'll be feeling much better in no time!"
