  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed your wellness report shows some areas we could work on together.  It's totally understandable to have off days, but consistently low sleep, water intake, and unhealthy food choices combined with lack of activity can really impact your mood and overall well-being.  Let's get you feeling better!\n\nHere are three simple tips to help you boost your wellness:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep & Hydration:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep tonight.  Even a small improvement can make a big difference.  Also, try to increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day. Keep a water bottle handy as a visual reminder.\n\n2. **Nourish Your Body:** Swap the chips and cola for a more balanced meal or snack.  Think fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your chip and cola, is a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:** Even a short walk can significantly improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-20 minutes of light activity today.  This could be a walk around the block, some stretching, or even dancing to your favorite music!\n\n\nRemember, small changes add up!  Focus on one or two of these tips at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get it perfect right away.  You've got this!"
