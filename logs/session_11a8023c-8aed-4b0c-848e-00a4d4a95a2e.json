  "response": "Hey there!  I noticed some things in your wellness report that might be impacting how you feel.  Getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, eating well, and moving your body are all really important for feeling your best, and it looks like you could use a boost in a few areas.  Don't worry, small changes can make a big difference!  It's totally normal to have days like this, but consistently neglecting these areas can lead to bigger problems down the line.\n\nHere are three tips to help you feel better:\n\n1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Try establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine (like a warm bath or reading), and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Even adding just an hour of sleep can make a significant difference in your energy levels and mood.\n\n2. **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Increase your water intake to at least 8 glasses a day.  Swap the chips and cola for more nutritious options like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.  Even a small change, like adding a piece of fruit to your diet, can be a step in the right direction.\n\n3. **Get Moving:**  Even a short walk or some light stretching can improve your mood and energy levels.  Start small \u2013 aim for 15-30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week.  This could be anything from a brisk walk to dancing to your favorite music.\n\n\nRemember, progress, not perfection, is key!  Start with one or two of these tips and gradually incorporate the others.  If you continue to feel tired and sad, consider talking to a doctor or mental health professional. They can offer additional support and guidance."
