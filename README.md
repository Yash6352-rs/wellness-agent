# ðŸ§  Wellness Agent â€“ AI-Powered Daily Health Companion

A lightweight, browser-based wellness assistant that provides instant, AI-generated lifestyle feedback based on daily inputs like sleep, hydration, mood, and activity â€” all without any devices, wearables, or logins.


This project was developed as part of the 15-day internship under GTU in collaboration with IBM SkillBuild and CSRBOX. The program focused on applying AI and emerging technologies to solve real-world problems. "Wellness Agent" is the final submission, showcasing the practical implementation of AI-powered wellness tracking using open-source tools.
